## Advisory Support

We offer step-by-step budgeted support to our *customers* for projects that have Data Scientists on board and that require support from the team.

In this setting, the Data Scientist from the project is responsible for driving the project and the DSP team will provide advice on project management and development: 

- Good coding practices 
- Documentation 
- Data Analysis, Model creation and/or evaluation, visualizations, deployment, etc.
- Project tracking

- Your algorithms are too complex to run on your laptop?
- Exploring data so that you can make the most of it (data cleaning, feature engineering, etc.)
- Evaluating a couple of Machine Learning models on clean data, to find the one that fits best to your needs (no pun intended)
- Making data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

Financing information is not included because this might bias people's questions/projects; the duration of projects should be based entirely in the objective estimation of effort/risks by the DSP. This of course will be communicated timely to the researcher/aanvrager.

Minder dan 160 uur, Financiering vanuit structurele bijdrage.
